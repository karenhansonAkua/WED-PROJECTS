        <h2>HOW TO DECORATE YOUR HOME </h2>
        <p>
            Moving into a new home can be one of life’s great joys, but it can also be a time of uncertainty, especially when it comes to decorating. How do you make your space look its best while reflecting your personal sense of style? Do it well and you’ll end
            up with a comfortable, happy home. Do it poorly and you’ll end up with a hodge-podge of furniture, fabrics and paint colors that never congeal into a pleasing whole. With a little planning, and by following the same steps used by professional
            interior designers, you’ll have a much greater chance of success.

        <h2>DONT START IN THE FURNITURE STORE</h2>

        <p>Many have heard the advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re hungry, because it leads to poor choices. The same holds true for furniture stores – don’t go shopping in a panic, just because you have an empty home. Yes, you need a sofa. But
            if you pick the pink-striped sectional just because you like it in the store, without taking measurements or thinking about the rest of the room, you’re stuck with it. The rest of the room will have to be built around that sofa, and if it’s
            too large for the space it will look forever awkward. Start in the room you’re looking to furnish, armed with a measuring tape and a notepad.
