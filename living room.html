        <P> The main living areas, whether they are separate rooms or combined in an open-concept space, set the stage for life with family and friends. Working from your floor plan and inspiration images, choose the specific pieces of furniture — the sofas,
            chairs and tables — that will make the space livable. Depending on the desired vibe, you can go in wildly different directions. For a traditional room, focusing on a symmetrical layout often helps — for instance, installing a sofa and coffee
            table centered on a fireplace, with matching armchairs on either side. “A very symmetrical space can be beautiful and formal,” said Ms. Hampton. On the other hand, “if you choose a sectional sofa, it’s probably going to be a less formal space,”
            she said, with an asymmetrical layout. Seat height is also important. Sofas and lounge chairs in the same room should have seats that are at similar heights to avoid some people sitting much higher than others. In general, lower seats offer
            a casual, laidback feel, and higher seats come off as more formal. Whether the space is casual or formal, there is a rule of thumb to keep in mind: The number of dining chairs should roughly match the number of spaces for lounging. “That’s
            an old truth my father shared with me,” said Ms. Hampton. “If you’re planning to have 12 people at a dining room table, you should have 12 seats in the living room,” for entertaining before and after the meal.

    <h2> CREATE THE PALETTE</h2>
    <div class="deco-tips">
        <p>
            You can see colors, patterns and metal finishes online, but digital images are mere approximations of what the real things look like. Wherever possible, order color chips, fabric swatches and material samples to be sure finished products will meet your
            expectations. “You can order samples from most vendors, and it’s always best,” said Mr. Kleinberg. “Some colors blend together,” when viewed on a screen, he added, and it can be difficult to differentiate cool and warm tones. Don’t just look
            at the samples in isolation. Pin them to a board or put them in a tray to see how well they work together. “All greens play nicely together,” said Mr. Kleinberg. “All blues fight.” Putting samples side by side is the way to see if different
            colors and patterns will live in harmony or tension. Ms. Hampton sometimes goes one step farther. “When we’re working on a fabric scheme, we’ll put the fabric on the copier, reduce it, cut it into the right shape for the floor plan and paste
            it down,” she said, “so we can see how the various fabrics spread through the room.”

    <h2>TREAT THE WALLS.</h2>

    <div class="deco-tips">
        <p>

            Paint colors are notorious for appearing different hues in different light conditions (and seeming to change between the paint store to home). This effect is only amplified once you slather it on four walls. For that reason, it’s never a good idea to
            commit to a paint color when you first see the chip in a store. Look at the largest chip you can get in the room you plan to paint, at a minimum. Better yet, paint large sample patches on walls or on boards that can be moved around and view
            them at different times of day.
