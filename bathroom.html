            The bathroom is one of the last places to receive the decorator’s hand in most homes, but a few simple touches can go a long way. Check out this natural wood slab that works wonderfully as a sleek and simple candle tray. Tuck this grainy goody into the
            corner of your jetted tub shelf to enjoy while you plunge into a deep soak or set it in between your double sink vanity where it can serve as a hub for organizing some of your everyday necessities. This piece of nature within your bathroom
            adds a fun and charming interesting decoration that doubles as a gorgeous design piece.

            It’s never too late to update your washroom and a little money will go a long way in this smallest of the rooms in your home. Slap on a fresh coat of your favorite shade in the white family of paint to make a clean and fresh backdrop to start your update.
            Next, you’ll delight in some vintage signs to identify the space and a plant or two. Add an industrial hook to hang your hand towel then finish off the look by framing your mirror with reclaimed rustic wood. The combination of textures along
            with the black and white color combination will make any homeowner or guest make the most of the moment when they have to go.
