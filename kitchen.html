            <h3>Customizing these spaces can add personality without requiring a gut renovation. </h3>
            Simply replacing cabinet pulls with new hardware can significantly change the look of a bathroom. The bathroom faucets are also no place to skimp – you touch them every day, so choose models that not only look good, but also have handles that feel reassuring
            when you turn them, and heads that offer the functionality you desire. In a bathroom, this line of thinking extends to accessories as well – quality towel bars, robe hooks and toilet roll holders can all give the room an upgraded appearance
            at minimal cost.

        <p>
            There’s no point in having nice towel bars if they’re holding frayed or mismatched towels. Recycle your old ones and buy new towels and washcloths in a single solid color (you deserve it). For a decorative accent, add patterned hand towels. If there’s
            a mildewed shower curtain around the tub, replace it with one made from a pleasing material like linen, or a glass panel. If the bathroom or kitchen floor leaves something to be desired, but you don’t want to go to the trouble or expense of
            tearing it out, you can cover it with a large woven vinyl rug or mat from a company like Chilewich or Bolon.
